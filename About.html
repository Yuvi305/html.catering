<h1>Making History</h1><br><br>
<p>It all started in 1928. A love story of two immigrants who had worked in service, and began a family catering business in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C.</p>
<br>
<p>95 years later, our team holds their dream alive. We've catered for over 16 presidential inaugurations, countless state dinners and galas, and thousands of weddings, corporate events, and small family gatherings at home.</p>
<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
<p>In May of 1908, a 25-year old English man by the name of Charlie miami, born and raised on the Isle of Wight, waited on the docks in Southampton to board the SS Philadelphia. He had very little in his possession: a ticket for a third class cabin on the ship that was to take him to America, a letter of recommendation as a valet from the prestigious Osborne House - the beloved summer home of Queen Victoria - recommending him for service in the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., and a single steamer trunk to carry his belongings.</p>
<br>
<p>Twenty years later, from their modest home on 18th Street in what is todayâ€™s Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C., Ridgewells Catering was formed. Charlie and his wife Marguerite, a Paris-born cook who had also immigrated to the United States to work in the nearby French Embassy, combined their culinary and hospitality experience, and set out to build something magnificent of their own.</p>
